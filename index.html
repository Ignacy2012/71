  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School Church</kbd></h4>
  <hr>
  <h5 class="text-succsess text-capitalize">Was established in 1978</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">The Apsáalooke people had occasional contact with the Jesuits beginning in 1840, including Father Pierre Jean DeSmet, the first “Black Robe” to visit what is now the State of Montana. By 1880 other Jesuits arrived to evangelize the reservation; they established a permanent mission here in February 1887. Fathers Peter Prando and Peter Bandini resided in a tent before constructing the first permanent building at St. Xavier, a two-story boarding school (which is no longer standing), staffed by Ursuline nuns. Construction of the 1888 rectory and a wooden Gothic style church soon followed. Money to build the church came from Philadelphia heiress Katherine Drexel, who founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament and donated her entire fortune to mission work. An excellent linguist, Father Prando soon translated hymns, Bible stories, and the catechism into Crow.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    However, the Jesuits saw the school as their best tool for gaining converts—both among the pupils and their parents. Punishments at the school could be harsh, and close-knit Crow families disliked the boarding school system because it took their children away from home. Nevertheless, most parents preferred the mission school to the agency school, and many families established camps nearby in order to see their children as often as possible. The mission also served as an orphanage and hospital; Father Prando particularly was well known as a healer. Eventually, government funding ceased, and the school closed temporarily, reopening as a Catholic day and boarding school. Unlike in the nineteenth century, in 2020, Crow language and culture were part of the curriculum.</p>

      <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School auditorium</kbd></h4>
      <hr>
      <h5 class="text-succsess text-capitalize">Was established in 1982</h5>
      <p class="text-muted">The stage has always been held in great honour at St. Xavier’s. For an educational institution an auditorium is not just a venue for school or college events, or merely a meeting place, it is a space where a corporation of students and scholars congregate – to celebrate, to debate, to discuss, and sometimes even to mourn collectively. As we stand at the threshold of another century in the history of St. Xavier’s College, it is meet that we go down memory lane and find out how students gathered here when it all began 130 odd years ago, how this place changed over the century, and how it is now poised to provide a space for even greater creative, cultural and social events, something that St. Xavier’s College has always been noted for.

<br>
<br>
<br>

      The growth of the St. Xavier’s Stage and auditorium took place separately in distinct and gradual phases, creating history of its own. The earliest history of the college hall goes back to 1885. The Old College Hall then served as a dormitory for the boarders as well as providing the most convenient place for dramatic performances. After 1885, great occasions, like the Prize Distribution Day, demanded more space than the hall could provide. For these functions a large shamiana was erected in the open.</p>

    <p>Science is not only about mere logical facts and technical figures. Science is about innovation, it provides the power to imagine and hence, create. Science is the poetry of reality. With this spirit, the Science Association of St. Xavierâ€™s College (Autonomous), Kolkata takes pride in bringing science to life by accommodating students with a keen interest in science, and providing them with the platform to showcase and even sharpen their skills. Established with an aim to foster interest for science, it sparks out fuel in the mind of science students, who seek to recognize an interest in scientific activities, and it further nurtures this interest with the help of inter and intra college extra-curricular activities. This session is not an exception. The association has conducted a wide range of activities throughout the academic session, 2019-20.

      It has organised Machine Learning Study Jams for its members, which was a great experience for the students to gain practical experience in Machine Learning and work with like minded people. The association has also actively encouraged research activities and blogging, and has commemorated scientific discoveries and scientists by way of the same. Finally, it has witnessed the thirteenth annual event of Science Association ‘SIGMA’, with the focal theme being “A Transit Through Time” on 11th and 12 of February, 2020. As all the departments of science converged in this fest, the theme, indeed, seemed befitting with a view of collaborating and conducting a variety of events ranging across all disciplines, be it, technology, biological sciences or the pure sciences. While general events included Treasure hunt, Debate and Quiz; events requiring specialisation in a particular field included an intriguing Integration Battle and Coding and Encryption. The Science Exhibition of Sigma, EUREKA was a grand success, where students were invited to present working models from various disciplines of science to share their innovative ideas and inspire other young aspirants as well. Apart from this, the event culminated with the launch of ‘Pebbles’, the Annual Magazine of Science Association. This year we have launched the magazine in soft copy version as we believe that it will have a better reach.
      
      The basic requirement for any country or society to set up model for development is new technology and that will be impossible without investment in science. So, this association serve as a platform for manifestation of the scientific aptitude of the students while indulging in healthy competition and other festivities throughout the year. We try to encourage each and every student from the disciplines of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Microbiology, Biotechnology, Computer Science, Economics, Statistics, Multimedia and Mass Communication departments to be a part of the association. Lastly we would like mention that we will be more than happy to have you by our side in our future journey.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-ld-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">St Xavier’s canteen is always overcrowded. Even school students from the senior section which is adjacent to the college, come in hordes during their recess. One gets a lot of choices for food and drinks like puri-sabzi, chicken patties, sandwich, cakes, rolls, tea, coffee, ice tea and many more and waiwai being pretty much demand. This canteen has been running for ages and has been renovated a couple of times. The new addition is a giant screen, where students crowd during matches or tournaments. Students come and sit and study as well. Why only students, even professors are fond of visiting the canteen, if not for anything else but for a cup of tea maybe!</p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-ld-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1.Regular attendance is a key requisite for all students of St. Xavier's. A student should have a minimum of 75% of class day's attendance (Examination Board Rule) failing which the student may not receive promotion to the next level. In such cases, such students would have to repeat in the same class or be withdrawn.
    <br>
    2. No pupil may absent himself/herself without obtaining leave previously, in writing. If for any reason, a student is absent without prior permission, on his/her return he/she must submit a letter from his/her parent/guardian, stating the reason for the absence and obtain permission from the principal or the vice principal before entering the class.
    <br>
    3. In all cases of absence, the parent/guardian should make an entry in the student's diary on the appropriate page marked 'Non Attendance and Leave Record".
    <br>
    4. For cases of absence for one or two days a student may get the record in the diary signed by the Class Teacher. But in cases of absence of three or more days, along with the diary entry, an application stating the reason for absence signed by the parent/guardian and counter-signed by principal or vice principal must be submitted to the Class Teacher on joining the class. Absence of three or more days on medical grounds must be confirmed by a copy of medical certificate along with the application.
